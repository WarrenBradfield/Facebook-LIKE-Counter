Simply put the index.php file in a sub-folder of your website (i.e. http://example.com/facebookcounter/) and load that page in your browser.

Usage
-----

All you need to do is copy a URL into the text-field at the top of the page, hit enter, and the page will display the number of times your URL has been liked. The count will update every 10 seconds.
